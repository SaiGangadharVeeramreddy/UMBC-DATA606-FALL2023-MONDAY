## Academic Projects:

### DATA 690 - Satistical Analysis and Visualization with Python : ANALYSIS ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY
- Through the utilization of Python's data analysis libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, an extensive examination of various elemental constituents and their respective percentages in water was conducted. Employing time series analysis, we investigated the temporal dynamics of these elements and their impact on surface water quality. The culmination of this study led to conclusive insights into the current state of Baltimore's surface water quality. Furthermore, we devised targeted procedures and interventions aimed at enhancing and optimizing the quality of surface water in Baltimore, facilitating its sustainable improvement.


### DATA 604 - Data Management : ANALYZING THE GUN VOILENCE IN USA
- The study entailed a comprehensive analysis of gun violence incidents in the United States spanning the years 2013 to 2017. The entirety of the data pipeline, including data processing, modeling, and interactive visualization, was executed leveraging Python within the Jupyter environment, AWS for data storage, and Power BI for visualization. The dataset was securely housed on AWS infrastructure. The primary objective revolved around discerning the diverse factors that influence gun violence incidents across different regions within the United States, a task achieved through the application of advanced visualization techniques in Power BI.


### DATA 603 - Platforms for Big Data Processing : ANALYZING THE LIQUOR SALES OF IWOA STATE
- An exhaustive analysis of Iowa State spirits sales statistics spanning the period from 2012 to 2022 was conducted. This encompassed a full-fledged data processing and modeling workflow executed through Python within the Jupyter environment, supplemented by MongoDB and Apache Spark for data management and manipulation. The data insights gleaned from this analysis encompassed trends assessment, vendor selection, item and package selection, and strategic placement recommendations, particularly relevant for the establishment of new liquor stores within Iowa State. These findings serve as a foundational basis for informed and data-driven business planning in the liquor retail sector within the state.


### DATA 602 - Introduction to Data Analysis and Machine Learning : CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ESTIMATION PROGRAM
- We constructed predictive models to assess the susceptibility to heart attacks based on patient diagnostic records obtained from a laboratory. Employing Python modules, we meticulously preprocessed the data, discerned underlying data patterns, and engineered predictive models to evaluate and present the outcomes. Additionally, we conducted model variations, stratifying the analysis by gender and identifying distinct parameters contributing to the risk of heart attacks. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of heart attack prediction, facilitating more precise risk assessment for patients while considering gender-specific factors.
